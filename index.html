		      <h3>Getting a Room</h3>
		      <ul>
			      <li>Only Brooklyn College undergraduate and graduate students and CUNY faculty are eligible to use the rooms that require a key.</li>
			      <li>Room reservations are recommended</li>
		      </ul>
		      <br>
		      <h3>Getting the Key</h3>
		      <ul>
			      <li>Study room keys are distributed at the <strong>New Media Desk</strong> during the hours that desk is open for up to 2 hours, 
				      or until 10 minutes before the desk closes (whichever is earlier).</li>
		      </ul>
		      <br>
		      <h3>Rules for Room Use</h3>
		      <ul>
			      <li>Food and drinks are not allowed in the study rooms. If you bring them in, you will be asked to leave the room immediately and 
				      may have future study room privileges suspended or revoked.</li>
			      <li>If you find food or drinks (including water bottles) when you enter the room, please report the condition immediately to the
				      New Media Desk so that you will not be considered responsible.</li>
			      <li>You may not obstruct the glass partition in a room. Doing so will cause you to forfeit the room immediately and may subject
				      its occupants to disciplinary action.</li>
			      <li>The person borrowing the key is the responsible party at all times. They must ensure that the room is vacated on time, that
				      the room remains tidy, and that the door is locked when leaving.</li>
			      <li>This person must hand the key back to the library staff member at the New Media Desk. If the desk is closed, place the key
				      in the return slot of the desk or leave it in the drop box outside the library.</li>
			      <li>Keys may not be removed from the library under any circumstances.</li>
			      <li>Rooms may be randomly checked by library staff and security.</li>
		      </ul>
		      <br>
		      <h3>Fines</h3>
		      <ul>
			      <li>If the responsible party fails to return the key on time, that person will incur fines. Generally, if a key is returned late,
				      there is a fine of $.10 (ten cents) per minute. Higher penalties are in effect during peak use periods. Please ask at the
				      Circulation Desk if you have any questions concerning the fines currently in effect. Fines for overdue fees continue to
				      accrue at these rates until the key is physically returned, regardless of whether or not the library is open. If a key is
				      left in the book drop after the New Media Desk has closed, fines will be charged until the key is checked in on the next
				      day that the library is open.</li>
			      <li>If a key is lost, the person borrowing the key will be responsible for the value of the replacement of the key and accompanying
				      lock (currently $100.00), processing fee ($25.00), and overdue fines</li>
			      <li>A lost key tag will incur a fee of $5.00.</li>
